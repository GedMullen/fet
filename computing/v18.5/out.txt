Title: FET warning
Message: Your data contains constraints students max gaps per day and/or activity tag max hours daily.

These constraints are good, but they are not perfectly optimized for speed. You may obtain a long generation time or even impossible timetables. It is recommended to use such constraints with caution.

Title: FET warning
Message: Your data contains constraints students min hours daily which allow empty days.

These constraints are nonstandard. They are recommended only if the students can have free days and a solution with free days for students exists. Otherwise the solution might be impossible for FET to find. It is recommended to use such constraints with caution.
