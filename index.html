			<h3>Manual Timetabling Issues</h3>
			<p>Creating timetables manually for educational establishments requires a considerable amount of time and is prone to inefficient compromises and error. This leads to underutilised resources such as equipment and rooms and unhappy staff and students.</p>
			<p>There are complex constraints at play such as multiple campuses, part-time staff and students and limited resources such as specialist rooms. In addition to this courses may share lectures, lecturers and rooms.</p>
			<p>There are a number of software solutions on the market that address this challenge but they require specialist skills and knowledge and often take longer to master than creating the timetables manually.

			<h3>An Automated Service Solution</h3>
			<p>The Timetabling Application Service (TAPS) provides timetable creators with an automated service that produces high quality timetables in a fraction of the time. A TAPS Administrator is allocated to the timetable creator who is then responsible for collecting the data required for the timetable along with the associated constraints. The TAPS Administrator then feeds the data and constraints into software to produce the required timetables. The software creates the “best fit” timetables based on the data and constraints provided.</p>
			<p>The TAPS Administrator advises the timetable creator of any conflicts and clashes along with recommendations for their resolution. This means that timetable creators can focus on what they require of their timetable rather than spending days trying to fit all the pieces together using a manual process. </p>
			<p>No specialist software knowledge is required by the timetable creator. The TAPS Administrator is responsible for working with the timetable creator and handling the technical complexities of feeding the data in the correct format into the software. Once the service is set up timetables can be improved and tweaked easily. Data analysis is provided for the timetables to ensure that they are accurate. See the <a href="/example">example timetable set</a>.
