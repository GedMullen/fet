Title: FET warning
Message: Optimization tip: There are 3 subgroups (from the total of 26 subgroups) which have the same activities as other subgroups. They are listed below. If the constraints relating to these subgroups are also the same, you can make the generation (directly proportional) faster by completely removing the subgroups which are equivalent to other subgroups (leaving only one representant for each equivalence set). (The generation algorithm will not completely remove the equivalent subgroups automatically.)

If you did not add all the activities yet or if the number of equivalent subgroups compared to the total number of subgroups is small, probably you can safely ignore this message.

You can deactivate this message from the 'Settings' menu.

Title: FET warning
Message: Your data contains constraints students max gaps per day and/or activity tag max hours daily.

These constraints are good, but they are not perfectly optimized for speed. You may obtain a long generation time or even impossible timetables. It is recommended to use such constraints with caution.

Title: FET warning
Message: Your data contains constraints students min hours daily which allow empty days.

These constraints are nonstandard. They are recommended only if the students can have free days and a solution with free days for students exists. Otherwise the solution might be impossible for FET to find. It is recommended to use such constraints with caution.
